TODO:
[] see what the CV error is for the "last quote" method
	[] use this to ascertain what the est number of folds is for this data
	[] start with 2, 5, 10 fold CV
	- because of the size of this, will only be able to do one cv type later
[] Naive Bayes type-a
	[] Fist get CV error
	[] apply to test data and submit
[] Naive Bayes type-b
	[] need to create a trainnig set for this
		[] shopping policies are now features (and costs), but you will need to include purchased policies into the mix too
[] k-NN
	[] play with distances
		[] uniform
		[] distance-based
		[] Mahalanobis via Cholesky transform
[] what would be the third option????


Modeling Techniques
===================

1. Last Policy
	- CV Error: 
		- 2-fold: 
		- 5-fold: 
		- 10-fold: 
	- Test Error: 0.53793
2. Naive Bayes 
	a. using record-type=1 only
		- features to include (only include features that make sense)
			- state
			- location
			- group_size 
			- homeowner
			- car_age
			- car_value
			- risk_factor
			- age_oldest
			- age_youngest
			- maried couple
			- C_previous
			- duration_previous
		- predict on policy suboptions independently
		- CV Error: 
		- Test Error:

	b. train on last shopping point
		- features to include
			- state
			- location
			- group_size 
			- homeowner
			- car_age
			- car_value
			- risk_factor
			- age_oldest
			- age_youngest
			- maried couple
			- C_previous
			- duration_previous
			- sub-options of last shopping 

	b.
	c.

1. submitted most recent plan for submission testing


Ideas
=====
- for features
	- use an age range instead of youngest and oldest
